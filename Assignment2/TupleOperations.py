#1. Can you modify the elements of a tuple after it has been created? Why or why not?

#No, you cannot modify a tuple after it is created.

#Reason:
#Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed once defined. This immutability makes tuples:

#Faster than lists

#Safer to use when data should not change

#Suitable as dictionary keys
